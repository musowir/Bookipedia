# Bookipedia

Bookipedia is a book recommendation project that utilizes neural network embeddings and Wikipedia links to generate personalized book recommendations. The system works by analyzing the features of each book, such as genre, author, and themes, and generating embeddings that represent these features in a high-dimensional space. The system then uses these embeddings to find books that are similar in content and style to the user's preferred books. Additionally, each recommended book is accompanied by a Wikipedia link that provides additional information about the book, such as the author's background and critical reception. The Bookipedia project has the potential to be used as a tool for avid readers looking to discover new books that align with their preferences and interests.
